vine that bears cucumiform fruits that are used as vegetables. There are three main varieties of cucumber: 
slicing, pickling, and seedless. Within these varieties, several cultivars have been created. In North America, 
the term “wild cucumber” refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, but these are not closely 
related. The cucumber is originally from South Asia, but now grows on most continents. Many different types of 
cucumber are traded on the global market.</p>

    <p>Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible
berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.</p>

<p>The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large
hen’s egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) in
diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or
golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.</p>
