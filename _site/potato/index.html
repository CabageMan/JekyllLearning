<!--        <p><p>Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely cultivated plant in the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae. It is a creeping 
vine that bears cucumiform fruits that are used as vegetables. There are three main varieties of cucumber: 
slicing, pickling, and seedless. Within these varieties, several cultivars have been created. In North America, 
the term “wild cucumber” refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, but these are not closely 
related. The cucumber is originally from South Asia, but now grows on most continents. Many different types of 
cucumber are traded on the global market.</p>

    <p>The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas, a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum, 
and the plant itself, a perennial in the family Solanaceae.</p>

<p>Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas, from the United States to southern Chile.
The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas 
independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and
wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme
northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated
approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago. In the Andes region of South America, where the species is 
indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.</p>
