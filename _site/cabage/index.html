vine that bears cucumiform fruits that are used as vegetables. There are three main varieties of cucumber: 
slicing, pickling, and seedless. Within these varieties, several cultivars have been created. In North America, 
the term “wild cucumber” refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, but these are not closely 
related. The cucumber is originally from South Asia, but now grows on most continents. Many different types of 
cucumber are traded on the global market.</p>

    <p>Cabbage or headed cabbage (comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea) is a leafy green, red (purple),
or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is 
descended from the wild cabbage, B. oleracea var. oleracea, and belongs to the “cole crops” or brassicas, 
meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera); 
and savoy cabbage (var. sabauda).</p>

<p>Cabbage heads generally range from 0.5 to 4 kilograms (1 to 9 lb), and can be green, purple or white. Smooth-leafed, 
firm-headed green cabbages are the most common. Smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of 
both colors are rarer. It is a multi-layered vegetable. Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at 
high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large. As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 
kilograms (138.25 lb).</p>
